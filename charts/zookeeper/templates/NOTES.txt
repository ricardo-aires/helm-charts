** Please be patient while the {{ .Chart.Name }} chart is being deployed in release {{ .Release.Name }} **

    {{ include "zookeeper.fullname" . }}-headless.{{ .Release.Namespace }}:{{ .Values.port.client }}

To connect to your ZooKeeper server run the following commands:

    $ kubectl exec -it -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "zookeeper.fullname" . }}-0 -- zookeeper-shell {{ include "zookeeper.fullname" . }}-headless.{{ .Release.Namespace }}:{{ .Values.port.client }}
